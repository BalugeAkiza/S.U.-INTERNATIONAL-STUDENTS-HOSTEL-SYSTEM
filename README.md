# INTERNATIONAL-STUDENTS-HOSTEL-SYSTEM
 Some students find hard to get a hostel around the university while it could be simple and easy using my system which allow students who are planning to study in Strathmore or they have already gotten their admission letter to view different hostels by their pictures, details, facilities,physical address, ownerâ€™s number and email address.
 This system tends to solve the issue by:
1.allow a Strathmore international student or a hostel owner to login or to register,
2.allow the International student to search for a hostel of his choice,allow the student to view all the available hostels around the campus, 
3.allow the administrator to login, update the hostels profiles, remove a hotel from the system in case it does not meet the requirements and he or she can add a hostel on the system;
 4.allow the hostel owner to be notified when a student books a hostel.
